                    <p>Since joining Aberdeen Institute of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, South China Normal University, I have consistently demonstrated enthusiasm for my academic pursuits, extracurricular research competitions and student work, as well as my personal interests. I have striven to maintain a healthy balance between my various commitments.</p>
                    <p>In terms of in-class learning, I take my course assignments seriously, including major assignments and presentations, and strive to maintain a GPA in the top 15% of my major. After two years of dedicated effort, I have maintained a GPA in the top 15% of my major. In extracurricular research competitions, I declared my research project early and participated in several mathematical modelling competitions with my classmates. At the same time, I won commendable awards in English learning, such as the first prize in the National Academic English Vocabulary Contest. In the summer of my freshman year, I passed the IELTS exam and achieved a score of 7, which met the requirements for promotion ahead of schedule. I am currently working to further improve my grades. In last year's comprehensive quality assessment of South China Normal University, I ranked first in my major in terms of total score, and two scores were the highest in the college.</p>
                    <p>In terms of my role as class president and secretariat staff of the JI's Student Union in my first year, I have gained a deeper understanding of the workings of the class and the Student Union system. I have also continued to develop my self-management and leadership skills in practice. In my second year, I was appointed head of the Secretariat of the Student Union, where I worked with department members to organise the brand activity ‘Tea Chat’. In addition, I fulfilled the role of the secretariat, and the interface work with the Student Union was completed successfully, which was also acknowledged by teachers and students. After school, as a member of the instrumental band, I have gained experience in the development of campus cultural activities, and I have become the leader of the instrumental band.</p>
                    <p>In my future study and work, I will continue to maintain a positive attitude, enrich my experience and improve my professional ability. Finally, I will strive to achieve satisfactory results in my postgraduate application.</p>
