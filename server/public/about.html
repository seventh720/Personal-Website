                    <p>Since joining Aberdeen Institute of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, South China Normal University, I have consistently demonstrated enthusiasm for my academic pursuits, extracurricular research competitions and student work, as well as my personal interests. I have striven to maintain a healthy balance between my various commitments.</p>

                        <summary>Curriculum Study</summary>
                        <p>In terms of in-class learning, I take my course assignments seriously, including major assignments and presentations, and strive to maintain a GPA in the top 15% of my major. After two years of dedicated effort, I have maintained a GPA in the top 15% of my major. In extracurricular research competitions, I declared my research project early and participated in several mathematical modelling competitions with my classmates. At the same time, I won commendable awards in English learning, such as the first prize in the National Academic English Vocabulary Contest. In the summer of my freshman year, I passed the IELTS exam and achieved a score of 7, which met the requirements for promotion ahead of schedule. I am currently working to further improve my grades. In last year's comprehensive quality assessment of South China Normal University, I ranked first in my major in terms of total score, and two scores were the highest in the college.</p>

                        <summary>Student Work</summary>
                        <p>In terms of my role as class president and secretariat staff of the JI's Student Union in my first year, I have gained a deeper understanding of the workings of the class and the Student Union system. I have also continued to develop my self-management and leadership skills in practice. In my second year, I was appointed head of the Secretariat of the Student Union, where I worked with department members to organise the brand activity ‘Tea Chat’. In addition, I fulfilled the role of the secretariat, and the interface work with the Student Union was completed successfully, which was also acknowledged by teachers and students. After school, as a member of the instrumental band, I have gained experience in the development of campus cultural activities, and I have become the leader of the instrumental band.</p>
                    </details>
                        <p>In my future study and work, I will continue to maintain a positive attitude, enrich my experience and improve my professional ability. Finally, I will strive to achieve satisfactory results in my postgraduate application.</p>

                    <img src="img/saxophone.gif" alt="Saxophone" Image width="220" height="220">
                <p>My hobbies are playing the saxophone. At university, I'm passionate about instrumental performance.</p>
                <details>
                    <summary>Personal experience</summary>
                    <p> In junior high school, I passed the Amateur Grade 10, and won the Gold Medal in the South China Regional Wind Solo Competition. While developing my interests, I also met many mentors and friends. All of them provide supports and encouragement for me when I am faced with difficulties and confusion. Now I gradually grew into an instrumental band leader who can perform on stage without stage fright. From my first performance in my freshman year to my most recent one, I have been on stage seven times on campus! Among them, the experience of wearing the Harry Potter costume at the Chinese-British Cultural Exchange Festival is still fresh in my mind.</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Team experience</summary>
                    <p>Before university, I had been training in the school's wind band, and I got to experience marching, indoor and outdoor orchestra performances. In junior high school, I also had the incredible opportunity to travel to the Golden Hall in Vienna to participate in the World Orchestra Competition, where we won a silver medal! When we started at the university, we weren't set on playing as an orchestra, but we could choose to combine. Recently, we played 'A jazz Christmas' as a sextet. It's a mix of 'We Wish You a Merry Christmas', 'O Christmas Tree' and 'Good King Wenceslas'. We got the hang of it after a few weeks of rehearsing and getting to know each other, and we had a good performance.</p>
                </details>
                <p>My performance photos are shown under my personal introduction. Below is a video of my recent performances (I'm on the second from left haha!). If you're interested, you can click through and take a look! Hope you'll enjoy it!</p>
