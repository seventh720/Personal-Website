## Overall design of my website
For my website project, I aim to craft a three-page personal site that not only serves as an online portfolio but also engages visitors with an interactive element. Here's a breakdown of my design approach for each page:

1. Introduction Page (Root):<br>
This will be the landing page where I introduce myself to the visitors. It will include a brief overview of my background, my field of study, and a glimpse into my interests and aspirations.

2. Detailed Information Page:
The second page will delve deeper into my personal and professional life. I plan to present a more nuanced view by discussing my professional interests, the courses I've undertaken, and the specific topics within my field that fascinate me. Alternatively, I could also showcase my hobbies and any notable achievements that reflect my passions outside of academia.

3. Interactive Quiz Application (Third Page):
The final page will be dedicated to an interactive quiz application. This will be a dynamic component that requires both front-end design and back-end functionality. I will implement this using JavaScript on the Node.js platform to ensure a seamless and engaging user experience.

Navigation System:
To ensure ease of use, I will integrate a navigation system that allows visitors to effortlessly move between the pages. This system will be intuitive and clearly visible on each page.
